The doorbot
=====

We had a problem at the Levo League with our intercom system. The doorbell rings and it rings a lot. Every single time a human would have to get up and press the door open button. We have an office manager who sits by the door and will eventually answer it. But if they're not around it's the front vs the back of the office both getting bitter that the other side never answers the door. (Usually it's both of us!)

This had to be stopped so Dorby was born.
